# This project is designed to emmulate the Facebook social media website.

This project utilizes firebase to allow a running server and database to store posts and users.
Through this, everyone can see the posts in order of which they were posted.

Further functionality may be added to allow users to limit the content they view and leave comments on other's posts.
